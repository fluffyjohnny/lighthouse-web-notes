## Writing Code Incrementally 
step by step process 
  * not thinking about syntax as your first go-to

should be thinking in terms of steps 
  1. State the hypothesis 
  2. verify the hypothesis 
  3. Make changes 
  4. Repeat the process 

we are writing the code for others to read 
  * utilize comment lines 
  * Readability is important 
  * Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

----------

## Problem Solving Tips
1. State the Hypothesis
    - focus on the core first, then come back to the edge cases.
    
2.  Verify the Hypothesis
    - only start thinking about the syntax after planning out the steps.

3. Make changes
    - Only start refractoring after the code is working. 

4. single functional principle 
    - a function should acomplish only a single goal.

## Basic Git Workflow 
### (init -> add -> coomit -> push)
- git status 
- git add .
- git commit -m "message"
- git remote -v (or add origin, rm origin)
- git push
  - set the upstream so you don't have to repeat the command everytime 
- git pull
- git log

* git branch 
  * gives the amount of branches that we have 
* git branch -a 
  * see all the local initialized repositories 
* git --help
  * shows all the commands and flags
