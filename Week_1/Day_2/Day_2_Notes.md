# Notes for W1D2
## Writing Code Incrementally 
* step by step process 
  * not thinking about syntax as your first go-to

* should be thinking in terms of steps 
  1. State the hypothesis 
  2. verify the hypothesis 
  3. Make changes 
  4. Repeat the process 

* we are writing the code for others to read 
  * utilize comment lines 
  * Readability is important 
  * Keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)


## Problem Solving Tips
* focus on the core first, then come back to the edge cases 
  * only start thinking about the syntax after planning out the steps 
* first make it work 
  * then refactor 
* single functional principle 
  * a function should acomplish only a single goal 

## Basic Git Workflow 
### (init -> add -> coomit -> push)
* git remote -v 
* git status 
* git branch 
  * gives the amount of branches that we have 
* git push -u origin main 
  * set the upstream so you don't have to repeat the command everytime 
* git --help
  * shows all the commands and flags 
* git branch -a 
  * see all the local initialized repositories
